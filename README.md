## Background
I grativated towards bullet journaling because I wanted a system that allowed me to track all my tasks but also key thoughts and feelings. Doing so allows me to be more aware of each day and better keep track of what energizes me.

## Key Features
- Input task/thought with timestamp (/ta for tasks, /th for thoughts)
- Switch between filter views (All, Tasks, Thoughts) 
- Manage outstanding tasks through toggle completion with visual aid: checkmark, strikethrough, gray text
- Items saved to Airtable automatically; loads previous entries on refresh with no manual save required

## Getting Started

- Context stuff Gemini so that it can make recommendations based on existing tasks and thoughts
